This is a small project I'm using to practice desktop app development.

The app can track books you've read and displays them under 3 different tables.

Currently Reading: books you are currently reading

Unfinished: books you have never finished and aren't currently reading

Finished: books you have finished at least once and aren't currently reading

There is a form for adding new books and a form for editing a book selected in one of the tables.

If you are downloading the repo, make sure to create a folder called "db" so that the sqlite methods are able to find the database.

Run the application with "python gui.py".
